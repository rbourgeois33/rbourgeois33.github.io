Hello world ! This is my first blog. I'm RÃ©mi Bourgeois, PhD. I am a researcher/engineer working at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). I work on the [TRUST platform](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/), a HPC (multi-GPU) CFD code that serves as a basis for many research/industrial applications.

I like to write about what I do as it forces me to formalize my idea, and because I think it might help others.

My research / engineering interests include:

- GPU kernel / application optimization.
- Using / picking GPU-enabled linear algebra libraries wisely.
- Finite volume methods, MHD convection see [my PhD thesis on the subject !](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04732720/)
- Continuous integration (gitlab / github).
- Communication avoiding algorithms.
- Experimenting with reduced precision.

The opinions expressed here are only mine, and do not reflect the opinions of CEA. Moreover, I am very prone to errors and quick conclusion. If you spot one, feel free to reach and discuss !
