# Basic performance tricks for porting kernels to the GPU.

## Some context and motivations
Hello world! This is my first blog post. I'm RÃ©mi Bourgeois, PhD. I am a researcher engineer working at the French Atomic Energy Comission (CEA). I work on the [TRUST platform](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/), a HPC (multi-GPU) CFD code that serves as a basis for many research/industrial applications.

 I was hired by CEA to join the porting effort of this legacy code to the GPU using [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos). This is quite a challenging task as the code is 20 years old, and more than 1400 kernels were identified to be ported to the GPU ! As I went and optimized some kernels, something struck me:
 
**The nature of the task of porting code to the GPU, especially when time is limited, often lead to small mistakes that can undermine performance.**

The goal of this blogpost is to give you basic, easy tips to keep in mind when writing/porting your kernels, so that you get a *reasonable* performance. 

By *reasonable* I do not mean that you are getting *optimal* perfomance. In fact, I will not go over what I consider to be *advanced* optimization tricks such as the use of shared memory [link] or vectorized operations [link]. By *advanced*, I do not mean that these topics are especially difficult, but only that they require a significant design effort to be used effectively in a production context such as a CFD code like TRUST. In contrast, I believe that the tricks I will give to you in this blogpost are easy enought so that you can apply them straightforwardly while porting your code to the GPU in a time limited environement.

## Disclaimer & Requirements
### Disclaimers

I am not an expert, if you think I wrote something that is wrong, please let me know !

I am running my performance tests on Nvidia GPUs, just because they are more easily available to me, and that I am more familiar with the performance tools such as nsight compute [link] (ncu) and nsight system [link] (nsys). However, note that AMD provides similar profilers, and that the advices that I give here are simple enought so that they apply for GPUs from both vendors.

Moreover, I will use Kokkos as the programming model, just because I work with it, and that performance portability is **cool**. Again, the concepts are simple enought so that you can translate it to your favorite programming model, OpenMP, SYCL, Cuda, Hip.

### Requirements

In this small tutorial, I will assume that you are already familiar with:
- Basic C++
- The reason why you might want to use the GPU, and that you need a big enough problem to make full use of it.
- What is Kokkos, why you want to use it and how to use it. Some ressources:
  - [Talk by Christian Trott, Co-leader of the Kokkos core team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3HHBl4kV7g). 
  - [Kokkos lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUIcWtFU5qM&list=PLqtSvL1MDrdFgDYpITs7aQAH9vkrs6TOF) (kind of outdated, but you can find a lot of ressources online, alos, join the slack !)
  - **Note:** you really should use Kokkos. It's cool enough so that CEA adopted it for it's legacy codes ! (see [the CExA project](https://cexa-project.org/)).
- Basic GPU architecture, in particular:
  - That you should avoid host to device memory transfers.
  - The roofline performance model
  - What does compute bound / memory bound mean.
  - Some knowledge about the memory hierarchy (registers, L1/L2 caches, DRAM) and the increasing cost of memory accesses.
  - Some ressources:
    - [1h30 lecture from Athena Elfarou on GPU architecture / CUDA programming](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62191/)
    -  [13 lectures on CUDA programming by Bob Crovella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsK8YFHTtNs&list=PL6RdenZrxrw-zNX7uuGppWETdxt_JxdMj)
 - Application-level optimization:
   - How to build a sensible optimization roadmap.
   - How to ensure that it is worth it to optimize the kernel you are looking (Don't assume bottleneck, profile, assess, optimize).
   - How to use Nvidia Nsight System
   - Some ressouces:
     - [8th lecture from the Bob Crovella lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhTjq0P9uc8&list=PL6RdenZrxrw-zNX7uuGppWETdxt_JxdMj&index=8)
