# Basic performance tricks for porting kernels to the GPU with Kokkos

## Some context and motivations
Hello world! This is my first blog post. I'm RÃ©mi Bourgeois, PhD. I am a researcher engineer working at the French Atomic Energy Comission (CEA). I work on the [TRUST platform](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/), a HPC (multi-GPU) CFD code that serves as a basis for many research/industrial applications.

 I was hired by CEA to join the porting effort of this legacy code to the GPU using [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos). This is quite a challenging task as the code is 20 years old, and more than 1400 kernels were identified to be ported to the GPU ! As I went and optimized some kernels, something struck me:
 
**The nature of the task of porting code to the GPU, especially when time is limited, often lead to small mistakes that can undermine performance.**

The goal of this blogpost is to give you basic, easy tips to keep in mind when writing/porting your kernels, so that you get a *reasonable* performance. 

By *reasonable* I do not mean that you are getting *optimal* perfomance. In fact, I will not go over what I consider to be *advanced* optimization tricks such as the use of shared memory [link] or vectorized operations [link]. By *advanced*, I do not mean that these topics are especially difficult, but only that they require a significant design effort to be used effectively in a production context such as a CFD code like TRUST. In contrast, I believe that the tricks I will give to you in this blogpost are easy enought so that you can apply them straightforwardly while porting your code to the GPU in a time limited environement.
